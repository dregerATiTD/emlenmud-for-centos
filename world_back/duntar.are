This massive portion of the dungeon is occupied by kobolds who have made
this their lair. All around you kobolds are greedily eating of the flesh of

Name The Shaman's Chamber~
Descr
Skulls line the walls and seem to grin back at anyone who dares look.
Skins of those who have died to feed the shaman's army form a nice rug to
wipe feet on. It soon becomes apparant that this idea of canniblizing the
psychotics is that of the shaman. Maybe someone will come along to slay this
evil creature and disperse the kobolds.
