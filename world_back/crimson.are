Name The Crimson Armory~
Descr
As you enter the shop, you take in a deep breath and notice the smell of
iron and steel amongst the hot air lingering around the room. Squatly
constructed with a low ceiling and narrow walls, this little store has
made its claim to fame as the only store in the region which sells any
sort of armor at all. Many different styles of armor made from many
different types of material line the walls and shelves of this shop.

Name The House of Pain[0;37m~
Descr
This cluttered shop is clearly not the home of a master craftsman. The
owner has evidently stopped caring about the appearance of his shop, and
as such has started to let it fall into ruin.

Name Thargon's Treasures~
Descr
The security here is the most severe you have ever seen. It is clear that
Thargon feels his little treasures are such a tempatation that he will
take no chances with miscreants. He eyes you with contempt as he 
examines a new broach he has just bought to get the highest price he can 
for it.

A great road travels north and south here. This road is one of the most
well-maintained in the land. Under your feet, you feel the cobblestones
which have been worn smooth by centuries of travellers, and the sign which
points toward the continuation of the road is weathered and grey with age.
The trees have been kept back from the edge of the road, to make it easier
to spot possible bandits, although the density of traffic discourages such
activity.

Name The Cityguard Training Center~
Descr
This the main training center the mayor uses to keep his troops fresh,
and to train new recruits. The smell of sweat makes you gag, and you must
tread lightly to avoid getting stabbed with a sword in the hands of a
novice.

Name A Small House~
Descr
This small home lacks most of the amenities one would desire, but
its inhabitants get by. There is really nothing of value, just a few
simple cooking supplies and furniture.

Name A Guard Barracks~
Descr
The inside of this large, new building is filled with weapons of every
description. The rooms smell of oil and steel, and the stench of sweat
from guards exerting themselves. The lighting is unnatural and an
eerie blue: evidently the guards are trained to see at night by keeping
the lighting level low in their barracks.
