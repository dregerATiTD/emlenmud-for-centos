The sea seems to go on forever in all directions, a seemingly
never-ending desert of water. It is said that the sea was created by a an
old god, a god that wept to see the world at war. Who knows for sure how the

The sea seems to go on forever in all directions, a seemingly
never-ending desert of water. It is said that the sea was created by a an
old god, a god that wept to see the world at war. Who knows for sure how the
sea got here?  But then, the sea is terribly salty...just like tears.
