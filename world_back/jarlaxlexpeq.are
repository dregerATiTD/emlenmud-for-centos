Descr
This secluded alcove really makes you feel at ease.  It is 
sparsly furnished, but the room gives off an aura of tranquility
and peace.  You can make out faint murals on the walls depicting
great battles.  There seems to be a common focal theme in these
pictures of a shadowy figure destroying richly adorned figures.

Name An old Musty Storeroom~

Once used to store grain, this room has now become a receptacle

Name The top of the Crier Tower~
Descr
This platform, a little higher than the Temple's outer walls, is
an awsome vantage point for surveying the surrounding area.  To the
north is a large park, east you see a multistory building with large
chimneys that waft lovely food smells, south is the cloud plains,
and to the west are many indistinguishable buildings and small gardens.

This platform, a little higher than the Temple's outer walls, is
an awsome vantage point for surveying the surrounding area.  To the
north is a large park, east you see a multistory building with large
chimneys that waft lovely food smells, south is the cloud plains,
and to the west are many indistinguishable buildings and small gardens.

Name A Vortex in the Cloud Plains~
Descr
The clouds roil, surge and churn around a central point in this part
of the plains.  The violence above and below emit erratic bursts of 
lightning and charge the air with static.  The noise of the electric
storms and the wild disturbances in the ether prevent you from casting.

Name An Anchored Vacuole~
Descr
You are in a vacuole.  A rare abberation that can only be described
as a bubble in reality.  Time flows trangely in these 'bubbles' and 
are often used for study, experiments or prisons.  It appears that
this one as been anchored somehow to the Sun Temple to prevent it 
drifting and being lost.
