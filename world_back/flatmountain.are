The trail ends here, and this area while still vaguely traversable
without assistance from climbing gear is a lot more rough and hazardous then
the trail you just stumbled off of. It is strewn with rocks and pebbles and

Name Along the Rim of A Great Mountain Range~
Descr
You stand along a narrow mountain ridge, the majority of the surrounding
area is entirely too steep to climb or even to attempt to climb or fly over
it. The region you are traveling on is nigh impossible to traverse in and of
itself, any more trecherous of terrain and you would be hard pressed to
survive it.

difficult traveling but this section of the broken trail seems to have

Name A Bone Filled Pit~
Descr
This is a natural pit, worn away by the forces of weather and time. The

The trail ends or begins here as it were, on a completely level and

from the ocean and half chilling from the mountains. Your hair ruffles and
blows about in a chaotic but pleasing manner, and you stare outward across
the ocean as if looking upon god.

as the wind whistles through your ears.

Name Atop a Mountain Ridge~

You stand atop a rocky but pretty much level part of a mountain ridge.
It is more of a plateau then a ridge really, but it's miniscule size makes
that definition almost not apply. Sharp and jagged rocks dig into your boots
once again making the towering spires in the distance appear to be laughing
as the wind whistles through your ears.
