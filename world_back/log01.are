Name Guard Room~
Cvnuml 139426960
Descr
Standing in a dimly lit back alley stand a few big and burly bouncers.
They seem to be guarding entrance into some elite club of some sort. It
would be interesting to see what's inside, but how to get past the guards?

to get in, hopefully the bouncers do their job.

Name A Small Room~

Blades line the walls and the floor, some seem very dull and well used,
while others seem brand new and deadly. The burly guy behind the desk seems
almost as though he can't be bothered, he is deeply focused on his work,
almost as if he is on a deadline.

Pieces of armor are flung everywhere, most of it with holes and dents in
it from the hardships of battle. The armorer seems hard at work trying to
straighten out every piece of armor. In the background a small gleam can be
seen, almost looks like it could be some new armor he is working on.

Upon entering the room a strong stench fills the air. The sign reads

and blood fill the air. In the back the baker can be seen bent over trying
to get a bun out of the oven.
