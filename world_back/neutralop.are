Name A Small Shelter~
Descr
Escaping the elements you find yourself under a small wooden shelter. The
shelter is covered in mold and vines, clearly showing the age and wear of
this structure. In one corner of the shelter you notice a small hole
concealed quite well by overgrowing weeds. The hole has stairs leading down
to another room.

Name Prexus's Home of Magic~
Descr
This strange little room seems to have the power of displacement. Tables
and chairs phase in and out of physical form creating a rather daunting
image. However much overcome you are by this incredible room you none the
less feel enlightened and refreshed to be here. A wonderful change from the
wild world you escaped.
