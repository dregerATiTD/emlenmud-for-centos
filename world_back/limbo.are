You find yourself standing on a hunk of earth floating high above a blue

There is obviously some very powerful magic at work here.  The land is flat,
and covered with green lush grass.  All around the circular top of the land
you see mighty trees growing.  They are fruit trees bearing fruit of all 
the known lands.  In the center of the ring of trees you see a huge, old tree.
While old, its leaves are deep green and its branches are full of a strange
unknown fruit.  Runes of an unknown race are carved into the tree and the
only word you can make out is H E X.

Name An Endless Field of Battle~
Descr
An endless bloody plain stretches out before you. Your feet squish
through blood and entrails, everywhere, in every direction there is nothing
but carnage. Fortunately this a battleground, and death isn't quite fatal
here, still the effects seem to appear rather realistic.
