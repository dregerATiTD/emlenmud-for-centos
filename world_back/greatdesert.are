is a great city while to the south is a road.

You are in a large expanse of desert that seems to stretch endlessly. The
landscape is dotted with dunes as far as the eye can see. It is a wonder

is a great city while to the south is a road.

You are near the Southwest Trail, however you are unable to discern a
difference between the quality of travel on the road and were you now stand.
You wonder if the trail nearby wasnt just some cruel joke from the twisted
mind of a Nomad.

You are in a large expanse of desert that seems to stretch endlessly. The

is a great city while to the south is a road.
