You are deep within the jungle, there is no turning back now. I hope you
find what you are looking for before the bugs devour all of your flesh. You
see traces of a trail here and there. There is also a pungent odor of
smoking flesh in the air. Hopefully it's not somebody you know.

Name Headshrinker Gogbooka's Hut~
Descr
As you look around the room, you can see dozens of shrunken orc heads.
The floor is covered with loose straw, most likely to absorb the excess
blood. There's an intricately carved oak table sitting in the middle of the
room with candles on it. Gogbooka doesn't seem to be much into cleaning or
keeping the room tidy. Behind one of the blood splatterings on the wall you
notice a familiar face. The head of Mog the orc is hanging on the wall here,
shrunken down much smaller than when Mog was alive.
