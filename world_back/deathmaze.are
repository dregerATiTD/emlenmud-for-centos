Name lesser scourge~
Short a lesser scourge~
Long 
A lesser scourge flies about here.
~
Descr
An exceptionally large mosquito, the scourge can frequently be found in
the wake of a demonic host. Aggressively hunting for blood, it's shear size
is what makes it dangerous. Only the females are normally encountered as the
males are of a normal size and do not need the blood of the living to breed.
Occassionaly these creatures can carry diseases.

You stand within a passage carved from the raw rock by some sort of

seems to warp in places, distance not quite seeming right. In fact as you
trace the outline of the walls they seem to converge at places, really
strange. No wonder this place is a testing ground.

You stand within a passage carved from the raw rock by some sort of
magical force. Quick and even cuts caused this passage to be almost
completely smooth, and it is encassed in a strange mossy substance. Space
seems to warp in places, distance not quite seeming right. In fact as you
trace the outline of the walls they seem to converge at places, really
strange. No wonder this place is a testing ground.

Name A Disorientingly Twisting Passage~
Descr
You stand within a passage carved from the raw rock by some sort of
magical force. Quick and even cuts caused this passage to be almost
completely smooth, and it is encassed in a strange mossy substance. Space
seems to warp in places, distance not quite seeming right. In fact as you
trace the outline of the walls they seem to converge at places, really
strange. No wonder this place is a testing ground.

You can feel the raw heat of the surroundings even here off the
firewalk. The ground here is fairly stable, with cracks and spots of molten
rock thrown in with the black volcanic substance that composes the ground.
You feel as safe as one can feel when standing just outside of a huge lava
flow.
